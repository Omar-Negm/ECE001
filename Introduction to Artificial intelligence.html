<div><h2>Since the invention of computers or machines, their capability to perform various tasks went on growing exponentially. 
Humans have developed the power of computer systems in terms of their diverse working domains, their increasing speed, and reducing size with respect to time.
A branch of Computer Science named Artificial Intelligence pursues creating the computers or machines as intelligent as human beings.</div></h2>

<div><h2>According to the father of Artificial Intelligence John McCarthy, it is “The science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs”. Artificial Intelligence is a way of making a computer, a computer-controlled robot, or a software think intelligently, in the similar manner the intelligent humans think.
AI is accomplished by studying how human brain thinks, and how humans learn, decide, and work while trying to solve a problem, and then using the outcomes of this study as a basis of developing intelligent software and systems</div></h2>

<div><h2>In the real world, the knowledge has some unwelcomed properties:
<ul> 
          <a><li>Its volume is huge, next to unimaginable.</a></li>
          <a><li>It is not well-organized or well-formatted.</a></li>
          <a><li>It keeps changing constantly.</a></li>
AI Technique is a manner to organize and use the knowledge efficiently in such a way that:
          <a><li>It should be perceivable by the people who provide it.</a></li>
          <a><li>It should be easily modifiable to correct errors.</a></li>
          <a><li>It should be useful in many situations though it is incomplete or inaccurate.</a></li>
AI techniques elevate the speed of execution of the complex program it is equipped with.</div></h2>
